                During my time at Builtdesign, I had the opportunity to work on
                a dynamic and user-focused project that involved designing and
                optimizing a website catering to a user base of over 4000
                individuals. My role as a full-stack web developer was to ensure
                a seamless experience for users by creating an efficient and
                maintainable platform.

                I collaborated closely with the product team to integrate
                cutting-edge features, employing technologies like Next.js and
                React with TypeScript for captivating front-end experiences.
                Additionally, I contributed significantly to the backend by
                utilizing Node.js, MongoDB, and GraphQL to design robust APIs
                and ensure smooth system functionality.

                This experience allowed me to enhance my skills in various areas
                of web development and deliver a high-quality product. I gained
                proficiency in front-end technologies such as Material UI and
                Tailwind CSS, as well as backend technologies including Nest.js
                and MySQL. The project&aps;s success in catering to a large user
                base and providing an intuitive user interface has further
                motivated me to pursue excellence in web development.
